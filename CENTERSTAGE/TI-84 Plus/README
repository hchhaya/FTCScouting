These are TI-Basic programs for the TI-84 Plus family of calculators to collect scouting data during an FTC tournament


SetupFTC – this needs to be run only once to set things up 

FTCScout – this needs to be run for each team that data is being collected from.

The data is saved in lists and can be seen in the list editor through the “Stat” (button) -> “Edit..” menu

These programs only collect the data and make it available for analysis.
